# Advent of Code 2017

My attempts at the Advent of Code. The extra challenge is that all of the challenges must be done in a completely randomized set of languages.

## Language Experience Scale

0 -> Have never heard of this language before.

1 -> Have heard of it, never used it.

2 -> Limited experience with language.

3 -> Worked on small projects, or small discrete pieces of code.

4 -> Worked on medium projects with others.

5 -> Know the language like the back of my hand.
